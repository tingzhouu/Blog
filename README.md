# Blog
This is a blog where one can compose posts and view posts. This repository serves to document my learning of using Javascript and Node.js to host a site on Heroku, using EJS to create templates and Layouts. I used MongoDB via Mongoose as a database to store the posts of the blog. 


## What I Have Used

**Express**
To create server, allow user to read specific full blog posts using route parameters

**Heroku-cli**
To deploy and host server

**EJS**
Uses EJS to create templates and layouts

**MongoDB and Mongoose**
To store composed blog posts

**Bootstrap**
Design of webpage

**body-parser**
Parse responses to Express


## Getting Started (non-web version)
Open terminal in the directory of folder

Key **node app.js** in terminal

Open your browser, type **localhost:3000/** and press enter!

To create a post, type **localhost:3000/compose** in the browser and press enter!

## Getting Started (web version)
Follow Heroku's **Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js** to use web version of the site
