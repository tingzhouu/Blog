# Blog
This repository serves to document my learning of using Javascript and Node.js to host a site on Heroku, using EJS to create templates and Layouts.

The site is a signup form for a newsletter. The signup list is maintained using MailChimp's API.


## What I Have Used

**Express**
To create server, allow user to read specific full blog posts using route parameters

**Heroku-cli**
To deploy and host server

**EJS**
Uses EJS to create templates and layouts

**Bootstrap**
Design of webpage

**body-parser**
Parse responses to Express


## Getting Started (non-web version)
Open terminal in the directory of folder

Key **node app.js** in terminal

Open your browser, type **localhost:3000/** and press enter!

To create a post, type **localhost:3000/compose** in the browser and press enter!

## Getting Started (web version)
